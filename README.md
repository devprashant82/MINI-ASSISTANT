(‘As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society.

Not just our laws and our rights and our budgets, but our thoughts and beliefs.’, ‘Hillary Clinton’) <br>
